# AoE-target-calc
Example project to help Airashawn from Infallible Code discord.
The purpose is to demonstrate AoE targetting of both 360 and specific Y angles.

There are 3 main MonoBehaviors.
- Target.cs - Target to get hit by AoE damage
- Bomb_AoE.cs - AoE 360 degrees
- Bomb_AoE_Angle.cs - AoE 90 degrees

Example image shows 2 targets.  1 will be hit by the 90 degree AoE blast and the other will not.

Debug raycasts are drawn to show hits and misses.  Turn on gizmos to see them.
